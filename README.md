# unsplashcl
CLI to interact with https://unsplash.com

## Why a new CLI when other tools exist?

Unsplash isn't just a photo-gallery, it's a community of generous photographers and consumers to share free photographs. The existing tools don't handle these attribution and credits to the creators of these photos. There is no single client supporting all of the 3 major platforms i.e OSX, Windows, Linux.

## DWoC

In DWoC, with 2 sub-projects, we'll try to build a good interface for Unsplash on the command-line, and build additional plugins to handle wall-papers.
